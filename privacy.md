Privacy Policy
---

We do collect information, but (with one exception details below) this is kept completely annomyous and never sold to third parties.

NOTE: We reserve the right to update or change this privacy policy at any time without providing notification. Simply put, sometimes things change or we forgot something and we have be able to make modifications. By using the app you are agreeing to this.

The type of data we collect includes (but is not limited to):
- Phone model
- Operating system type and version
- What content is clicked on and the amount of time spent reading them (so we know what is popular, and what is not)
- General location (city, district, state, country)
- Any errors generated by the app (for use in debugging)
- If you shared the content via social media (but we do not collect your account name or any information around it)

The only time we collect non-annomyous data is when the user submits a donation to the organization and gives us their payment information. Most of the time this is done through a third party so we will only receive your name, email and the amount donated. We do not disclose this information in any way to third parties.

If there are any questions or concerns about this please contact the publication via their website.
